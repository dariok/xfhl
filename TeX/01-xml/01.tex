\section{What is XML?}
\par The Extensible Markup Language, or XML, is a formalised language, originally
               defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1998. It is by far not the
               oldest markup language but one of the most frequently used markup languages today. When it was designed,
               several design principles were closely followed to improve other, older markup languages. This careful
               design process is one of the reasons of its success. To better understand the design principles, we need
               to take a closer look at the basic reasons for using and concepts behind markup languages in general.
